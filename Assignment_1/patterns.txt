// In this file you can put your regular expressions
// for matching non-standard words (like mail addresses).
//
// As you have probably already understood, lines beginning
// with "//" are comments.
//
// The regular expression below is an example of a useful
// pattern. You can keep it, modify it, or remove it, as you
// wish.



// ADD YOUR PATTERNS HERE


// Email
[a-zA-Z0-9!`@\\_\-.]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.]+

// Compound word (xxxx-xxxx)
\w+-\w+

// abbreviation
[a-zA-Z0-9.]+.

// Twenty-four seven
\d+/\d+


// The patterns will be tried from top to bottom, so it is a
// good idea to put more specific patterns above more general
// patterns.
